      "botulinica": "Botulinum toxin is a powerful ally in combating wrinkles and expression lines, promoting a lighter, rested and natural facial appearance. We use Dysport®️, a brand worldwide recognized for high efficacy, faster onset and excellent durability of results. In addition to facial rejuvenation, the toxin is indicated for treating bruxism, tension headaches and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), bringing more comfort and quality of life to the patient.",
      "colageno": "Over time, our skin loses collagen, resulting in sagging and loss of support. Collagen biostimulators are applied to naturally activate the production of this essential protein, improving firmness, texture and facial and body contour. The treatment is progressive and safe, with long-lasting results and a natural appearance. It’s indicated for those who want to treat sagging without resorting to volumizing fillers.",
      "hialuronico": "Hyaluronic acid filler is a safe and effective technique to restore lost volume, soften folds and enhance natural facial features. Indicated for regions such as lips, dark circles, jawline, chin and nasolabial folds, the treatment promotes facial harmonization with naturalness, respecting each patient’s individuality. With immediate results, the procedure provides a more rested, harmonious and luminous expression. The application is precise, personalized and focused on naturalness, facial balance and sophistication. An ideal choice for those seeking subtle and effective rejuvenation.",
      "skinbooster": "Skinbooster is a deep hydration treatment that injects specific hyaluronic acid into the inner layers of the skin, without adding volume. The result is more vital, firm skin with smooth texture and natural glow. It’s ideal for treating areas such as face, décolleté, neck and hands, especially in devitalized, dehydrated skin or skin needing complete revitalization.",
      "blefaroplastia": "Renewed eyes without surgery. Non‑surgical blepharoplasty is a modern and effective treatment to rejuvenate the eye area without surgical incisions. We use two advanced technologies — hybrid CO₂ laser and plasma jet — that promote precise contraction of eyelid skin, stimulate collagen and improve firmness, resulting in a more youthful, open and rested appearance. Why does hybrid CO₂ stand out? The hybrid CO₂ laser combines ablative and non‑ablative beams in the same handpiece, acting on multiple skin layers simultaneously. This yields more effective results, shorter recovery time, and greater safety and comfort.",
      "blefaroplastia2": "Plasma jet: a delicate and precise alternative. For milder cases or patients with more sensitive skin, plasma jet may be indicated. It creates retraction points on the skin surface, improving sagging with controlled healing. It’s an excellent option for those seeking a more superficial procedure with faster recovery.",
      "plasma": "State‑of‑the‑art laser technology to treat sagging, wrinkles, enlarged pores, irregular texture and loss of glow in a single protocol, with no needles and no surgery. Fotona 5D®️ combines five laser modes in one session, working on different skin layers with maximum precision. It promotes a non‑invasive and natural lifting, with intense collagen stimulation, improving firmness, facial contour, luminosity and texture — including around the eyes and mouth. Ideal both for prevention of aging and for mature skin with visible signs of sagging and elasticity loss.",
      "melasma": "Melasma is a chronic condition characterized by brownish patches on the skin, mainly on the face, more common in women aged 20 to 50. Factors such as sun exposure, hormonal fluctuations, genetic predisposition and even stress can aggravate it. Although it doesn’t cause physical pain, melasma can cause deep emotional discomfort, directly affecting self‑esteem, confidence and quality of life. At our clinic, we treat melasma with an individualized and multidisciplinary approach, combining technology, science and continuous care.",
      "tricologia": "Baldness: when hair loss goes beyond aesthetics. Androgenetic alopecia is a progressive condition that affects millions of men and women, and can begin in youth. More than a cosmetic concern, it often impacts self‑esteem, social life and emotional well‑being.",
      "gordura": "Localized fat is one of the most common body complaints, and even people with appropriate weight or good habits may have persistent accumulations in regions such as abdomen, flanks, back, arms and double chin."
