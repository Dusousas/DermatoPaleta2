      "botulinica": "Botulinum toxin is a powerful ally in fighting wrinkles and expression lines, promoting a lighter, rested and natural appearance to the face. We use Dysport®, a brand recognized worldwide for its high effectiveness, faster onset of action and excellent durability of results. In addition to facial rejuvenation, the toxin is indicated in the treatment of bruxism, tension headaches and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), bringing more comfort and quality of life to the patient.",
      "colageno": "Over the years, our skin loses collagen, which results in sagging and loss of support. Collagen biostimulators are applied to naturally activate the production of this essential protein, improving firmness, texture and facial and body contour. The treatment is progressive and safe, with lasting results and natural appearance. Indicated for those who want to treat sagging without resorting to volumizing fillers.",
      "hialuronico": "Hyaluronic acid filling is a safe and effective technique to restore lost volumes, soften grooves and enhance natural facial features. Indicated for regions such as lips, dark circles, jaw, chin and nasolabial folds, the treatment promotes facial harmonization with naturalness, respecting the individuality of each patient.",
      "skinbooster": "Skinbooster is a deep hydration treatment that injects specific hyaluronic acid into the inner layers of the skin, without volume effect. The result is more vigorous, firm skin with a smooth texture and natural shine. It is ideal for treating areas such as face, décolletage, neck and hands, especially in devitalized, dehydrated skin or skin that needs complete revitalization.",
      "blefaroplastia": "Non-surgical blepharoplasty is a modern and effective treatment to rejuvenate the eye area without the need for surgery. We use two advanced technologies — hybrid CO₂ laser and plasma jet — that promote precise contraction of the eyelid skin, stimulate collagen and improve firmness, resulting in a younger, more open and rested look.",
      "plasma": "For milder cases or patients with more sensitive skin, plasma jet may be indicated. It generates retraction points on the skin surface, promoting improvement in sagging with controlled healing. It is a great option for those seeking a more superficial procedure with faster recovery.",
      "melasma": "Melasma is a chronic condition that manifests as brownish spots on the skin, mainly on the face, more frequently in women between 20 and 50 years old. Factors such as sun exposure, hormonal variations, genetic predisposition and even stress can aggravate the condition.",
      "tricologia": "Baldness (androgenetic alopecia) is a progressive condition that affects millions of men and women, and can start as early as youth. More than an aesthetic concern, it usually directly impacts self-esteem, social interaction and emotional well-being of those who suffer from hair loss.",
      "gordura": "Localized fat is one of the most common body complaints, and even people with adequate weight or good habits may present persistent accumulations in regions such as abdomen, flanks, back, arms and double chin."
